# Blind Source Separation of Diffusion MRI 

With blind source separation (BSS) one can separate microstrucutre tissue components from diffusion MRI signal. Due to hardware restriction in the MR scanners, this is only possible up to two compartments. Thus, BSS is a suitable tool for free-water elimination

Here we open source a python implementation ready to use in your dataset.
